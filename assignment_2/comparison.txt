COMPARISION:

Best First Search (Greedy) uses only the heuristic to guide the search.
It explores the node that looks closest to the goal but may miss the true shortest path.
Itâ€™s faster but not always optimal.

A* uses both the cost so far (g) and the heuristic (h), 
ensuring that the found path is the shortest possible (optimal) if the heuristic is admissible.
It may explore more nodes than Greedy but guarantees correctness.
